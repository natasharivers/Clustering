# Clustering

### This repository contains material from my time as a student at Codeup.

- In this repo you will find exercises and notes on:
    - data wrangling
    - exploratory analysis
    - modeling
    - using clusters


- All of the material in this repository culminates with a **Zillow Clustering Project** 

- That repo is available for viewing at: https://github.com/natasharivers/Zillow_Clustering_Project
